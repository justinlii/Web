Organic compounds possess potential energy as a result of the arrangement of electrons in the bonds between their atoms. Through the activity of enzymes, a cell systematically degrades complex organic molecules that are rich in potential energy to simpler waste products that have less energy. Some of the energy is taken out and can be used to do work; the rest is dissipated as heat..

Two forms of energy harvesting / catabolic process : anaerobic and aerobic respiration. 
Aerobic respiration: oxygen is consumed as a reactance 
Some prokaryotes use substances other than oxygen as reactants in a similar process that harvests chemical energy without oxygen. 
Catabolic pathways (breakdown) do not directly contribute to cellular work. Catabolism is linked to work by a chemical drive shaft- ATP

At keysteps, electrons are stripped from the glucose. Each electron travels with a proton , thus as a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen atoms are not directly transferred to oxygen, but are psased first to electron carrier/coenzyme Nicotinamid adenine dinucleotide (derivative of the vitamin niacin). This conenzyme is very well suited as an electron carrier because it can easily cycle between oxidized and reduced form. 

Enzymes called dehydrogenases remove 2 electrons and 2 portions from substrate (glucose). The enzyme delivers the 2 electrons along with 1 proton to conenzyme NAD+, forming NADH. The other proton is released as a hydrogen ion into the surrounding solution. By receiving 2 e- and 1 +,  the NAD+ is neutralized and reduced to NADH. 

(ETC) Electron transfer from NADH to oxygen is an exergonic reaction. Instead of this energy being released and wasted in a single explosive step, electron cascade down the chain from one carrier molecule ot the next in a series of redox reactions, losing a small amount of energy with each step until it reaches oxygen, the terminal electron acceptor. 
Each downhill carrier is more electronegativee than, and thus capable of oxidizing its “uphill” neighbor, with oxygen at the bottom of the chain. 

Glycolysis
Glycolysis can be divided into two phases, the energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase. ATP is later produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose. The net yield from glycolysis (per glucose molecule) is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH



Hexokinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to glucose making it more chemically reactive. The charge on the phosphate also traps the sugar in the cell (It becomes polar)

Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose  6-phosphate by phosphoglucosiomerase

Phosphofructokinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the opposite end of the sugar, investing a second molecule of ATP. This is a key step for regulation of glycolysis. 

Aldolase cleaves the sugar molecule into two different three-carbon sugars. 

Conversion between DHAP and G3P: This reaction never reaches equilibrium G3P is used in the next steps as fast as it forms. The enzyme isomerase facilitates this reaction. 

Two sequential reactions: G3P is oxidized by the transfer of electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. Using energy from this exergonic redox reaction, a phosphate group is attached to the oxidized substrate, making a high-energy product.  Triose phosphate dehydrogenase
The phosphate group is transferred to ADP (substrate-level phosphorylation) in an exergonic reaction. The carbonyl group of G3P has been oxidized to the carboxyl group (-COO-) of an organiz acid (3-phosphoglycerate). 

The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the remainign phosphate groups.

Enolase causes a double bond to form in the substrate by extracting a water molecule, yielding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a compound with a very high potential energy.

The phosphate group is transferred from PEP to ADP, a second example of substrate-level phosphorylation), forming pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes this reaction. 

 After pyruvate is oxidized, the citric acid cycle completes the enrgy-yielding oxidation of organic molecules. Most of the energy still remains in the pyruvate molecules. When O2 is present, the pyruvate in eukaryotiic cells enters the mitochondria. 
Pyruvate molecules enter the mitochondria via active transport. 
It is first converted to a compound called acetyl conenzyme A
Pyruvate’s carboxyl group (–COO-), already somewhat oxidized, is now fully oxidixe and given off as a molecule of CO2
The remaining two carbon fragment is oxidized and the electrons transferred to NAD+, storing the energy in the form of NADH
Conenzyme A, a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached via itss sulfur atom to the -carbon intermediate, forming acetyl CoA. This molecule has high potential energy.

 <h2> The Krebs Cycle </h2>
 <p>
Acetyl CoA (from pyruvate oxidation) adds its two-carbon acetyl group to oxaloacetate, producing citrate. Citrate synthase is the enzyme catalyzing this reaction

Citrate is converted to its isomer, isocitrate, by removal of one water molecule and addition of another. Catalyzed by the enzyme aconitase. 

Isocitrate is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH. Then the resulting compound loses a CO2 molecule forming (a-Ketoglutarate). This reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase. 

Another CO2 is lost and the resulting compound is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH. The remaining molecule (Succinyl CoA) is then attached to coenzyme A by an unstable bond. This reaction is catalyzed by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. 

CoA is displaced by a H-phosphate group, which is transferred to GDP, forming GTP, a molecule with functions similar to ATP. GTP can also be used to generate ATP. Succinate is formed at the end of this reaction

Two hydrogens are transferred to FAD, forming FADH2 and oxidizing succinate, turning it into Fumarate. The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the removal of two hydrogens from succinate and adding tem to FAD forming FADH2. Fumarate is formed. 

Addition of a water molecule rearranged bonds in the substrate, and forms Malate. Catalyzed by fumarase.

The substrate (Malate)  is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH and regenerating oxaloacetate (OAA 4 carbon molecule). It is catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase. 

Citrate is the ionized form of Citric Acid. The next 7 steps decompose the citrate back to OAA. It is this regeneration of OAA that makes the process a cycle.

We can tally up the molecules produced by the citric acid cycle. For each acetyl group entering the cycle, 3NADH are made . FAD accepts two electrons and protons which becomes FADH2. In many animal cells, the reaction at step 5 produces a GTP. It may be used to make an ATP or directly used to power work in the cell. In plants, bacteria, and some animal cells step 5 forms an ATP molecule by substrate phos. 

The total yield per glucose is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP per 2 pyruvates/ 1 glucose molecule

 <h2> The Electron Transport Chain </h2>
 <p>
The ETC is a collection of proteins and molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Cristae are the foldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane, increasing surface area, providng space for thousands of copies of the ETC.  Most components of the chain are proteins, which exists in multiprotein complexes numbered I through IV. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components such as cofactors and coenzymes essential for the reactions. 

Electrons acquired from glucose by NAD+ during the processes of glycolysis, and krebs cycle are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the ETC in complex I, flavoprotein (FMN).
Flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it psases electrons to Fe-S complex I. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called uniquinone (Q) - small hydrophobic molecule, not a protein (only one in the ETC). It is individually mobile, another name is conenzyme Q/COQ.
Most of the remaining electron carriers between Q and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and dontaes electrons. 
The ETC has several cytochromes, each named with “cyt”
The last cytochrome, Cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electroneg. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of protons from the aqueous solution, neutralizing the charge, forming water.
FADH2 addis its electrons from within complex II, at a lower energy level.
The ETC eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in smaller amounts. The mitochondria coupe the electron transport and ATP synthesis through a mechanism called chemiosmosis. 

AtP synthasase used the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP formation. The power source = gradient of H+ establish on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

The ETC is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. 

Certain members of the electron transport chain accept and releasee protons along with electrons. At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause protons to be taken up and released into the surrounding solution. In eukaroyotes, the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane so that protons are accepted from the matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space. 

The gradient that results is called the proton-motive force

Chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that sues energy stored in the form of a proton gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. 

Maximum ATP yield for glucose is 30-32

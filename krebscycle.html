   <h2> The Krebs Cycle </h2>
 <p>
Acetyl CoA (from pyruvate oxidation) adds its two-carbon acetyl group to oxaloacetate, producing citrate. Citrate synthase is the enzyme catalyzing this reaction
Citrate is converted to its isomer, isocitrate, by removal of one water molecule and addition of another. Catalyzed by the enzyme aconitase. 
Isocitrate is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH. Then the resulting compound loses a CO2 molecule forming (a-Ketoglutarate). This reaction is catalyzed by isocitrate dehydrogenase. 
Another CO2 is lost and the resulting compound is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH. The remaining molecule (Succinyl CoA) is then attached to coenzyme A by an unstable bond. This reaction is catalyzed by the alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. 
CoA is displaced by a H-phosphate group, which is transferred to GDP, forming GTP, a molecule with functions similar to ATP. GTP can also be used to generate ATP. Succinate is formed at the end of this reaction
Two hydrogens are transferred to FAD, forming FADH2 and oxidizing succinate, turning it into Fumarate. The enzyme succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the removal of two hydrogens from succinate and adding tem to FAD forming FADH2. Fumarate is formed.  Addition of a water molecule rearranged bonds in the substrate, and forms Malate. Catalyzed by fumarase. The substrate (Malate)  is oxidized, reducing NAD+ to NADH and regenerating oxaloacetate (OAA 4 carbon molecule). It is catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase. 
Citrate is the ionized form of Citric Acid. The next 7 steps decompose the citrate back to OAA. It is this regeneration of OAA that makes the process a cycle.
We can tally up the molecules produced by the citric acid cycle. For each acetyl group entering the cycle, 3NADH are made . FAD accepts two electrons and protons which becomes FADH2. In many animal cells, the reaction at step 5 produces a GTP. It may be used to make an ATP or directly used to power work in the cell. In plants, bacteria, and some animal cells step 5 forms an ATP molecule by substrate phos. 

The total yield per glucose is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 2 ATP per 2 pyruvates/ 1 glucose molecule

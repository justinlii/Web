<h2> The Electron Transport Chain </h2>
 <p>
The ETC is a collection of proteins and molecules embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells. Cristae are the foldings of the inner mitochondrial membrane, increasing surface area, providng space for thousands of copies of the ETC.  Most components of the chain are proteins, which exists in multiprotein complexes numbered I through IV. Tightly bound to these proteins are prosthetic groups, nonprotein components such as cofactors and coenzymes essential for the reactions. 

Electrons acquired from glucose by NAD+ during the processes of glycolysis, and krebs cycle are transferred from NADH to the first molecule of the ETC in complex I, flavoprotein (FMN).
Flavoprotein returns to its oxidized form as it psases electrons to Fe-S complex I. The iron-sulfur protein then passes the electrons to a compound called uniquinone (Q) - small hydrophobic molecule, not a protein (only one in the ETC). It is individually mobile, another name is conenzyme Q/COQ.
Most of the remaining electron carriers between Q and oxygen are proteins called cytochromes. Their prosthetic group, called a heme group, has an iron atom that accepts and dontaes electrons. 
The ETC has several cytochromes, each named with “cyt”
The last cytochrome, Cyt a3, passes its electrons to oxygen, which is very electroneg. Each oxygen atom also picks up a pair of protons from the aqueous solution, neutralizing the charge, forming water.
FADH2 addis its electrons from within complex II, at a lower energy level.
The ETC eases the fall of electrons from food to oxygen, breaking a large free-energy drop into a series of smaller steps that release energy in smaller amounts. The mitochondria coupe the electron transport and ATP synthesis through a mechanism called chemiosmosis. 

AtP synthasase used the energy of an existing ion gradient to power ATP formation. The power source = gradient of H+ establish on opposite sides of the inner mitochondrial membrane. 

The ETC is an energy converter that uses the exergonic flow of electrons from NADH and FADH2 to pump protons across the membrane, diffusing down its gradient. 

Certain members of the electron transport chain accept and releasee protons along with electrons. At certain steps along the chain, electron transfers cause protons to be taken up and released into the surrounding solution. In eukaroyotes, the electron carriers are spatially arranged in the inner mitochondrial membrane so that protons are accepted from the matrix and deposited in the intermembrane space. 

The gradient that results is called the proton-motive force

Chemiosmosis is an energy-coupling mechanism that sues energy stored in the form of a proton gradient across a membrane to drive cellular work. 

Maximum ATP yield for glucose is 30-32

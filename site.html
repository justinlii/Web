<h1> Biologyâ€“ Cellular Respiration </h1>
   <p>
Cellular respiration is a set of metabolic reactions and processes that take place in the cells of organisms to convert chemical energy from oxygen molecules
or nutrients into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and then release waste products.[2] The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions, which break large molecules 
into smaller ones, releasing energy because weak high-energy bonds, in particular in molecular oxygen,[3] are replaced by stronger bonds in the products. Respiration is one of
the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity. The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps, some of which are redox reactions.
Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction, it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow, controlled release
of energy from the series of reactions. Cellular Respiration is one of the most essential chemical reactions that occur in our bodies. The reaction is typically represented with 
the breakdown of glucose but any macromolecule can undergo the steps of cellular respiration to generate ATP.

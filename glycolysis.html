<h2> Glycolsis </h2>
  <p>
Glycolysis can be divided into two phases, the energy investment phase and the energy payoff phase. ATP is later produced by substrate-level phosphorylation and NAD+ is reduced to NADH by electrons released from the oxidation of glucose. The net yield from glycolysis (per glucose molecule) is 2 ATP plus 2 NADH
Hexokinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to glucose making it more chemically reactive. The charge on the phosphate also traps the sugar in the cell (It becomes polar) Glucose 6-phosphate is converted to fructose  6-phosphate by phosphoglucosiomerase Phosphofructokinase transfers a phosphate group from ATP to the opposite end of the sugar, investing a second molecule of ATP. This is a key step for regulation of glycolysis.  Aldolase cleaves the sugar molecule into two different three-carbon sugars. 
Conversion between DHAP and G3P: This reaction never reaches equilibrium G3P is used in the next steps as fast as it forms. The enzyme isomerase facilitates this reaction. 

Two sequential reactions: G3P is oxidized by the transfer of electrons to NAD+, forming NADH. Using energy from this exergonic redox reaction, a phosphate group is attached to the oxidized substrate, making a high-energy product.  Triose phosphate dehydrogenase
The phosphate group is transferred to ADP (substrate-level phosphorylation) in an exergonic reaction. The carbonyl group of G3P has been oxidized to the carboxyl group (-COO-) of an organiz acid (3-phosphoglycerate).  The enzyme phosphoglyceromutase relocates the remainign phosphate groups. Enolase causes a double bond to form in the substrate by extracting a water molecule, yielding phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a compound with a very high potential energy. The phosphate group is transferred from PEP to ADP, a second example of substrate-level phosphorylation), forming pyruvate. Pyruvate kinase catalyzes this reaction. After pyruvate is oxidized, the citric acid cycle completes the enrgy-yielding oxidation of organic molecules. Most of the energy still remains in the pyruvate molecules. When O2 is present, the pyruvate in eukaryotiic cells enters the mitochondria. 
Pyruvate molecules enter the mitochondria via active transport. It is first converted to a compound called acetyl conenzyme A. Pyruvate’s carboxyl group (–COO-), already somewhat oxidized, is now fully oxidixe and given off as a molecule of CO2 The remaining two carbon fragment is oxidized and the electrons transferred to NAD+, storing the energy in the form of NADH
Conenzyme A, a sulfur-containing compound derived from a B vitamin, is attached via itss sulfur atom to the -carbon intermediate, forming acetyl CoA. This molecule has high potential energy.
